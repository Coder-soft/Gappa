## FAQ

#### Is Gappa Free?

Oh Yes it is you don`t even have to pay for a single penny

#### Why Does Gappa stays offline most of the time?

Gappa is free, which means I don't earn any money from it or my other projects. Because of this, I have to host Gappa locally, which causes it to be offline most of the time.
